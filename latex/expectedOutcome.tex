\section{Expected Outcome}

By transitioning to a cloud computing structure, SmartV can expect significant benefits both to the company themselves, as well as the user experience. 

\begin{itemize}

    \item Moving to the cloud will ensure greater scalability for the company going into the future. This will allow for more users to subscribe and use the service concurrently. 

    \item More cost effective as there is no need to buy hardware upfront, ensuring less overhead. 

    \item More data centres around the world, meaning connectivity to the service will be great for people regardless of their location in the world.

    \item Virtualisation of storage into a singular pool making upgrading storage and adding, modifying, and deleting data much simpler.

    \item Ensure data security through backups and increased redundancies.


\end{itemize}
