\section{Considerations and Challenges}

The development of SmartV's cloud infrastructure has forced several key considerations and challenges.

\subsection{Private and Public Cloud}

One critical consideration is the choice between private and public cloud deployment models. While a private cloud offers dedicated resources and enhanced control over security and infrastructure management, there are also much higher initial costs in acquiring the requisite physical infrastructure. By contrast, use of a public cloud provides scalability and cost-efficiency, but reduces the level of control over the underlying infrastructure.

For a web-based and consumer-facing platform such as SmartV, it was decided that ability to easily scale infrastructure to platform usage was a crucial aspect of the transition to cloud infrastructure, and was the primary factor in the choice to use the AWS public cloud.
