%\begin{itemize}
%    \item \textbf{Storage:} Large scale, globally accessible storage for video content.
%    \item \textbf{Compute:} Scalable and flexible compute for work with video content, such as streaming, editing and transcoding.
%    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The ability to scale horizontally and vertically as needs of the business expand over time. This should be trivial once the system is deployed.
%    \item \textbf{Networking:} Networking internally in the cloud components needs to facilitate high bandwith data transfer.
%    \item \textbf{High Availability:} Redundancy and high availability is necessary to retain high uptime during disaster recovery or upgrades.
%    \item \textbf{Automatic Scaling (DRS):} The ability to match demand for vrious resources, notably compute, to automatically scale as demand increases and decreases.
%    \item \textbf{Resource Control:} Deploying the environment through infrastructure as code allows traceable and consistent changes.
%    \item \textbf{Backups:} In case of disaster, backups should be available for all content throughout the system.
